I/O Queue
- To queue a callback function into the I/O queue, there are a number of methods. Most of the async methods from the built in modules queue the callback function in the I/O queue
- One of the async method is the readFile method from the fs module

- Sixth Experiment Inference: Callbacks in the microtask queues are executed before callbacks in the I/O queue
- Seven Experiment Inference: When running setTimeout with delay 0ms and an I/O async method, the order of execution can never be guaranteed.
    * Why can the order of execution never be guaranteed?
        - The anormally is because of how a minimum delay is set for timers
- Eight Experiment Inference: I/O queue callbacks are executed after Microtask queues callbacks and Timer queue callbacks
