Modules
- A module is an encapsulated and reuseable chunk of code that has it own context
- In nodejs, each file is treated as a separate module but is isolated by default

Types of Modules
1. Local Modules : Modules that we create in our application
2. Built-in Modules : Modules that node.js ships with out of the box
3. Third party modules : Modules written by other developers that we can use in our application.

Local Modules
- CommonJS : CommonJS is a standard that states how a module should be structured and shared
    Node.js adopted CommonJS when it started out and is what is seen in code bases

Loading a Module
- To load a module into another file, we use the require function
- When the file is executed, the code in the module is executed as well
- If the file we are requiring is a javascript file, we can skip specifying the extension and node.js will infer it on our behalf.
