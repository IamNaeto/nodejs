Character Sets
- Binary data
    * Computers store and represent data in binary format which is a collection of 0s and 1s
    * Example :  Data       Binary Digits
                   1            1
                   2            10                  Using base 2 numeric system, this is how the conversion is done, using 4 as example
                   2            11                  |   1     0       0        |
                   4            100                 | 2^2*1 + 2^1*0 +   2^0*0  |
                   5            101                 | 4     +   0   +    0     |
                   6            110                 |  = 4                     |    
                   7            111
                   8            1000
                   9            1001
                   10           1010
    * Each 0 or 1 is called a binary digit or cbit for short
    * To work with a piece of data, a computert needs to convert that data into a binary representation

    Character in Binary Format
    - V in binary format?
    - Computers will first convert the character to a number, then convert that number to its binary representation.
    - Therefore, computers will first convert V to a number that represents  V
    - Typing in the dev tool console "V".charCodeAt() will out put the number of chartacter V as 86
    - 86 is the numeric representation of the character V
    - It is also called character code
    - How does the computer know V should be represented as 86? This brings the topic character sets

    Character Sets
    - Character set are predefined lists of characters represented by numbers
    - Popular character sets are 
        * Unicode and 
        * ASCII
    - Unicode character set dictates that 86 should represent character V
    
    Character Encoding
    - Character encoding dictates how to represent a number in a character set as binary data before it can be stored in a computer
    - It dictates how many bits to use to represent the number
    - Example of a character encoding is UTF-8
    - UTF-8 states that characters should be encoded in bytes (8 bits)
    - Eight 1s and 0s should be used to represent the code of any character in binary
    - 4 => 100 => 00000100
    - V => 86 => 01010110
