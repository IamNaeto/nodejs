Timer Queue 
- Timer queue is technically not a queue, it is a main heap data structure, but for our understanding thinking its a queue makes the process simplier
- To queue a timeout function into the timer queue, we can use either the setTimeout function or the setInterval function
- Here is the syntax for setTimeout
            setTimeout(() =>{
                console.log("This is setTimeout 1")
            }, 0);
        * The first argument is a callback function
        * The second argument is the delay

- Third Experiment Inference : Callbacks in the microtask queues are executed before callbacks in the timer queue
- Fourth Experiment Inference : Callbacks in microtask queues are executed in between the execution of callbacks in the timer queue
- Fifth Experiment Inference : Timer queue callbacks are executed in FIFO order
