Thread Pool
- This is a pool of thread that nodejs uses to offload time consuming task and ensure the main thread is not blocked for a long time
- It is notable that every method in node.js that has the "sync" suffix always runs on the main thread and is blocking
- A few methods like fs.readFile and crypto.pbkdf run on a seperate thread in libuv's thread pool. They do run synchronously in their own thread but as the main thread is concerned. It appears as if the methodis running asynchronously
