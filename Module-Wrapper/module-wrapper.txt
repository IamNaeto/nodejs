Module Wrapper
- Every module in node.js gets wrapped in an IIFE before being loaded
- IIFE helps keep top-level variables scoped to the module rather than the global object
- The IIFE that wraps every module contains 5 parameters which are pretty important for the functioning of a Module
- The parameters are 
    * exports
    * require
    * module
    * __filename (double underscore filename)
    * __dirname (double underscore directory name)
