Publishing An NPM Package
- To publish a package, you just have to run one command
- npm publish
- However before doing that, you need to create an account on npmjs and sign into the account in vscode
- First head over to npmjs.com and click on signup
- Enter a username, email and password
- An OTP will be sent to your email which you will need to enter in the next screen
- Once this is successfully done, head back to vscode
- In the terminal run the command npm space adduser <username>. This is the same username you would have entered on npmsjs
- When you press enter it will prompt you for password and email address
- Once you have successfully completed that step, you are ready to publish your package
- In the terminal run the command npm publish
- If it succeeds you can head over to https://npmjs.com/package/package_name
- For example, from our package.json our package name is first-published-package. soo the route to head over to will be https://npmjs.com/package/first-published-package
