Built In Modules
- This is code that nodejs provide out of a box to help us build applications.
- The first built in module is the path module

Path Module
- The path module is a built in moudle that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- To make use of a built in module, we firt have to import it
- To import a built in module we use the require() function at the top of the file
- const path = require("node:path") Here path is the name of the built in module and its prefixed with node to indicate its a built in module.
- When requiring the built in module, it is important to note that there is no ./ at the beginning
- Once the module is loaded, the various properties and methods exposed by that module can be accessed
- The path module has about 14 different properties and methods but there are just 7 that is regularly used.
- The most readily available is  __filename(double underscore filename) and __dirname(double underscore directory name)

Different Paths Methods Available In The Path Module
1. Basename : Returns the last portion of a path
2. Extname : Returns the extension of the path
3. Parse : Returns an object whose property represents significant elements of the path.
4. Format : Returns a path string, given an object
5. isAbsolute : Returns whether a path is absolute or not
6. Join :  Joins all given path segments together using the platfrom specific seperator as a delimator and then normalizes the resulting path. It accepts one or strings as arguments
7. Resolve : Resolves sequence of paths or paths segments into an absolute path


NB:
- When importing the built in module, the node prefix is optional
- Node is smart enough to figure out that the imported module is a built in module
- However the node protocol has many benefits

node: Protocol
- Makes it perfectly clear that the import is a Node.js builtin module
- Makes the import identifier a valid absolute URL
- Avoids conflicts for future Node.js built-in Modules
- So, its recommded to always include the node prefix when importing the node.js builtin module
