Import Export Patterns
1. Exporting and importing a single variable or function
2. Directly assigning the arrow function to module.exports
3. Exporting more than one variable or function by either using 
    - module.exports equals to an object with the functions name inside of it seperated by commas
    - After enquring the modules with the exported object of variable or function, destructuring can be made to single out the functions or variables.
4.  Defining the function and directly assigning it to a property on module.exports
5. Using IIFE that wraps every module in nodejs by replacing module.exports with just exports.
    -NB: this is not ideal and the best practice is to use module.exports
