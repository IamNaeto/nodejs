I/O Polling
- To queue a callback function into the check queue, we can use a function called setImmediate
- The syntax is similar to process.nexTick were we pass in a call back function
- The syntax is showed thus :
            setImmediate(() => {
                console.log("This is setImmediate 1")
            })
- Ninth Experiment Inference: I/O events are polled and callback functions are added to the I/O queue only after the I/O is complete
