Thread Pool Size
- Libuv thread pool has four threads by default.
- When we execute pbkdf2 five times, the first fourth each take their own thread and complete nearly the same time. The fifth call however has to wait for a thread to be free. When hash one is complete, hash five runs on the thread and finishes resulting in twice the amount of time taken in total.
- By increasing the thread pool size, we are able to improve the total time taken to run multiple cores of an asynchronous method like pbkdf2
- One important point to keep in mind when increasing the thread pool size is that if its increased beyond the number of cpu cores your machine has, the avarage time per method of execution also increases.
- Increasing the thread pool size can help with performance but that is limited by the number of available CPU cores.
