Streams Recap
- A stream is a sequence of data that is being moved from one point to another over time
- Streams in other words allows us to work with chunks of data rather than large amount of data at once
- Ex: A streeam of data being transfered from one file to another within the same computer
- The idea is to work with data in chunks instead of waiting for the entire data to be available at once
- If you are transfering file contents from fileA to fileB, you don't wait for entire fileA content to be saved in temporary memory before moving it into fileB
- Instead the content is tranfered in chunks over time which prevents unnecessary memory usage.
- Stream is infact a built-in node module that inherits from the event emitter class
- Streams is rarely used directly.
- Other modules internally use streams for their functioning
- The buffer that streams use has a default size of 64kb
-  higerWaterMark is use to specifiy the size of chunk of data

Types of Streams
- Readable streams from which data can be read
    * Ex: reading from a file as readable stream
- Writable streams to which we can write data
    * Ex: Writing to a file as writable stream
- Duplex streams that are both Readable and Writable
    * Ex: Sockets as a duplex stream
- Transform streams that can modify or transform the data as it is written and read
    * Ex: File compression where you can write compressed data and read de-compressed data to and from a file as a transform stream.
