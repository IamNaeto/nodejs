Streams and Buffers

Recap
- Binary Data : 0s and 1s that computers can understand
- Character Sets : Predefined lists of characters represented by numbers
- Character Encoding : Dictates how to represent a number in a character set as binary data

Streams
- A stream is a sequence of data that is being moved from one point to another over time
- Ex 1. A stream of data over the internet being moved from one computer to another
- Ex 2. A stream of data being transferred from one file to another within the same computer
- In nodejs, the idea is to process streams of data in chunks as they arrive instead of waiting for the entire data to be available before processing
- Ex 1. Watching a video on youtube
- The data arrives in chunks and its been watched in chunks while the rest of the data arrives over time
- Ex 2. Transfering file contents from fileA to fileB
- The contents arrive in chunks and is been transfered in chunks while the remaining contents arrive over time
- This helps to prevent unnecessary data downloads and memory usage

Buffers
* Analogue using a rollercoster
    - 30 seating capacity

    * Scenario 1
    - 100 people arrival
    - 30 people accommodated
    - 70 people in queue (waiting)

    * Scenario 2
    - 1 person arrives (waiting : He or she have to wait inline for atleast 10 people to arrive in total to improve efficiency)
    - Wait for at least 10

* Area where people wait is nothing but the buffer
* Nodejs cannot control the pace at which data arrives in the stream
* It can only decide when is the right time to send the data for processing
* If there is data already processing or too little data to process, node puts the arriving data in a buffer
* It is an intentionally small area that Node maintains in the runtime to process a stream of data
* Ex : Streaming a video online
    - If the internet connection is fast enough when streaming, the speed of the stream will be fast enough to instantly fill up the buffer and send it out for processing
    - That will repeat till the stream is finished
    - If the connection is slow, after processing the first chunk of data that arrived, the video player will display a loading spinner which indicates it is waiting for more data to arrive
    - Once the buffer is filled up and the data is processed, the video player shows the video
    - While the video is playing, more data will continue to arrive and wait in the buffer

* Binary data, character sets and encoding <==> Buffers? (What is the connection)

* Nodejs provides the buffer as global feature that can be used without having to import it
* Nodejs internally uses buffers where required making it possible that you may never work with buffers directly
