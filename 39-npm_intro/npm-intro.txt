npm
- What is npm
    - npm is really two things
        * It is the world's largest software library(registry)
        * It is a software package manager

npm is a Software library
- A book library contains books written by various authors
- npm is a library or a registry which contains code packages written by various developers
- It is a large public database of JavaScript code that developers from all over the world can use to share and borrow code
- If you author a "code package", you can publish it to the npm registry for others to use
- On the other, if you come across a code package that is authored by someone else and solves the problem you have at hand, you can borrow that code without having to reinvent the wheel
- Visiting npmjs.com leads to the npm website where one can search for package in the registry

npm is a Software Package Manager
- Developers publish and consume code packages
- But there is a there is a lot to consider while building a system around that
    * How does a developer publish a package
    * How does a developer consume a package
    * What happens if the code package author decides to change a function name in a package
    * How would one update an already installed package?
    * What if the package I am consuming is dependent on another package?
        - Managing packages in a project as one can see is not as simple as it seems. This is where npm as a package manager comes to the rescue
        - We have access to a command line interface tool that lets us manage packages in a project

npm and Other Package Managers
- Other package managers are pnpm and Yarn
- npm is the default package manager for node.js and is installed when nodejs is installed
- To verify if npm is installed, in the terminal run npm -v
- There is no need for seperate installation because it is bundled with nodejs

npm
- npm did stands for node package manager when it first started out
- Now, it is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language

Why learn about npm?
- When building enterprise scale applications, we often need to reply on code written by other developers, we need npm
