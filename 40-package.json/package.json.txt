package.json
- package.json is npm's configuration file
- It is a json file that typically lives in the root directory of your package and holds various metadata relevant to the package
- package.json is the central place to configure and describe how to interact with and run your package
- It is primarily used by the npm CLI

Fields in the packgae.json file
- The file begins with a pair of curly braces and inside of it, we have the Fields
- There are two mandatory fields, name and version
    * name field defines the name of the package. It must be lower case, one word and may contain hypens or underscores
    * version field must be in form x.x.x and follows the symantics versioning guildlines
- Other fields are;
    * description field that is used to search and describe packages in the npm registry
    * keyword fields is an array of strings. It is indexed by the npm registry that helps to find packages when someone searches for them
    * main field defines the entry point of our projects

Note: 
- We don't have to manually create the package.json file. Typically we use the npm CLI to initialze a project with package.json
- To create a package.json using the npm CLI, on the terminal run;
    * npm init     
- If you want to stick to the default and just change the project name, you can use the --yes option. So in the terminal run the command;
    * npm init --yes 
    * This will generate a package.json file with the default values without prompting for any user input
