Module Scope : Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) in Node.js
- Each loaded module in Node.js is wrapped with an IIFE that provides private scoping of code.
- IIFE allows the repetition of variables or function names without any conflicts

    (function(){
        //Module code actually lives in here
    })

- Before a module's code is executed, Node.js will wrap it with a function wrapper that provides module scope
- This saves us from having to worry about conflicting variables or functions
- There is proper encapsulation and reusability is unaffected
