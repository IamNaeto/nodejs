Global Package
- Some packages published to the npm registry are meant to be used as stand alone command line applications
- Such packages are intended to be run from a terminal and used directly in code like a local dependence will be
- On the frontend, a good example is the create-react-app command line application which is used to start out a react project
- For nodejs, a very popular globally installed package isnodemon
- It is a simple monitor script for use during development of a nodejs app
- It automatically restarts the node application when file changes in the directory are dictected
- Nodemon is a package intended to be used from the terminal
- It can be found in the npmjs.com website
- The command to install is npm instal -g nodemon
- The option -g instruct npm to install the package globally to your system path
- That will allow us to run the package from the command line regardless of where you run the command from
- Once the installation is complete you can run nodemon filename to monitor
    * Example nodemon index.js
- It is important to note that global packages are not listed as a dependence for a single project and because of this running npm install will not install the package
- Global packages have to be installed on there own by every single developer in the terminal
- On a side note, to uninstall a global package, run 
    * npm uninstall -g package name
    * Example npm uninstall -g nodemon
- Global packages are primarily utilities and tools written in nodejs which can help us during development
