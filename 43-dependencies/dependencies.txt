Dependencies
- Dependencies field is normally created and populated when a package is installed
- It is a way for the npm to track the packages that are required for the function of our code 
- In a real world application, the dependencies list might contain anywhere between 5 and 50 different npm package.
- All the code will be present in the node modules folder and this folder can be megabyte in size
- Instead of commiting this folder to source control, we will git ignore it
- That is when another developer in our team clones the code, the will not have the node modules folder
- npm install scans package.json for any dependencies and automatically install then and aswell regenerate the modules folder if not available initially
- These are the role of the dependencies field in package.json configuration file
