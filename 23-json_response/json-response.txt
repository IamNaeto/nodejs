JSON Response
- JavaScript object or array of object cannot be sent as is in a response
- What we have to do is to convert it to JSON format
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation is a data interchange format that we can use with http
- The nice thing about using json format is that the V8 engine has built in functionality to support what we want to achieve
- All we have to do is to invoke the built in method JSON.stringify(/Then pass in our object or array of object/)
- We do however have to specify to the browser that the content type is json by setting the content type to application/json
- All these are sufficient to send a json response back to the client
