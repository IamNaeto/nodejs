- Using just exports moifies the properties that exist on the exports object
- From a module, nodejs only returns module.exports and not the exports object. Exports is just a reference to module.exports
- Although exports is shorter than module.exports, this confussion of attaching to the exports object vs assigning a new object to export is not just worth it.
- Using module.exports is ideal and the best practice
