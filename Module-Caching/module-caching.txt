Module Caching
 - caching is or can be refer to another word for remembering
 - In nodejs when we require a new module, it is loaded and cached for subsequent loading
 - Caching helps with performance

Seneriors where we need to create seperate instances of SuperHero (class)
- Instead of exporting an instance that will be import, we export the class itself

NB: Modules imported or exported incorrectly may/can lead to unexpected bugs
